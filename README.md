## Overview

**ViTX** is a **Vi**sion-**T**e**X**t representation learning framework on top of [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) and HuggingFace [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/) for Cross-Modal Perception research. It is designed to be readable and easily extensible, to allow users to quickly run and experiment with their own ideas.

## Installation

### Dependencies

ViTX requires **Python 3.6+**.

- hydra-core>=1.0.0
- numpy>=1.22.4
- rich>=12.4.4
- pytorch>=1.12.0
- torchvision>=0.13.0

<!-- ### PyPI Installation
You can install Lightly and its dependencies from PyPI with:
```
pip install clhive
``` -->

### Manual Installation
It is strongly recommend that you install ViTX in a dedicated virtualenv, to avoid conflicting with your system packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/naderAsadi/ViTX.git
cd ViTX
pip install -e .
```


## Code structure
- `configs/`: Directory to store experiment  configurations, all in .yaml format.
- `examples/`: Directory for example files showcasing the usage of the codebase.
- `scripts/`: General purpose, single file scripts.
- `vitx/`: The main source code
  - `config/`: Data Classes and utility function to parse and sanity check YAML configs.
  - `data/`: Classes for reading the data, transforming, and tokenizing it.
  - `losses/`: Classes as `nn.Modules` holding the implementation of several loss functions. 
  - `methods/`: Classes that contain the pipelines for each method, e.g. training and inference functions.
  - `models/`: Model classes. e.g. CLIP, SLIP.
  - `utils`: Utility functions.
    
## How To Use

With `vitx` you can use uni-modal and multi-modal self-supervised methods in a modular way using the full power of PyTorch. Experiment with different backbones, models and loss functions. The framework has been designed to be easy to use from the ground up.

### Quick Start

  
Usage of `main.py` file:

```shell
python main.py \
        data=<data_config_name> \
        model/vision_model=<vision_model_config_name> \
        model/text_model=<text_model_config_name> \
        +arg=<value> \
        ...
```

Example:

```shell
python main.py \
        data="coco" \
        model/vision_model="vit-b" \
        model/text_model="vit-b"
```
